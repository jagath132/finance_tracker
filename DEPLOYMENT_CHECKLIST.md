# Deployment Checklist & Next Steps

After setting up GitHub secrets, follow this checklist to get your CI/CD pipeline running.

## ✅ Prerequisites Checklist

- [ ] GitHub repository created and accessible
- [ ] Netlify account with staging and production sites
- [ ] Supabase project configured
- [ ] Android keystore generated (optional, for signed APKs)
- [ ] All GitHub secrets configured (see SETUP_SECRETS.md)

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Push Code to GitHub

```bash
# Ensure you're on the main branch with all changes
git checkout main
git status  # Check for any uncommitted changes
git add .
git commit -m "Setup CI/CD pipeline and responsive fixes"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Verify Pipeline Setup

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on **Actions** tab
3. You should see these workflows:
   - ✅ Deploy Web to Netlify
   - ✅ Build and Deploy Mobile App
   - ✅ Rollback Deployment
   - ✅ Test CI/CD Pipeline

### Step 3: Test Staging Deployment

```bash
# Create and push to develop branch for staging
git checkout -b develop
git push origin develop
```

**Expected Result:**

- GitHub Actions will trigger
- Build will run and pass
- Staging site will be deployed to Netlify
- Check Netlify dashboard for deployment URL

### Step 4: Test Production Deployment

```bash
# Merge develop to main
git checkout main
git merge develop
git push origin main
```

**Expected Result:**

- Production deployment will trigger
- App will be deployed to production Netlify site

### Step 5: Test Mobile Build

The mobile build will run automatically on pushes to main/develop.

**To check:**

1. Go to GitHub Actions → Build and Deploy Mobile App
2. Check the artifacts section for APK downloads

## 🔍 Monitoring & Troubleshooting

### Check Pipeline Status

1. **GitHub Actions**: Repository → Actions tab
2. **Netlify**: Dashboard → Deployments
3. **Build Logs**: Click on any failed job to see detailed logs

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### ❌ Build Fails

- Check Node.js version (should be 18)
- Verify environment variables are set
- Check for TypeScript/linting errors

#### ❌ Netlify Deployment Fails

- Verify NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN permissions
- Check site IDs are correct
- Ensure sites exist in Netlify

#### ❌ Mobile Build Fails

- Check Android keystore configuration
- Verify Java 17 is available
- Check Capacitor sync

#### ❌ Secrets Not Found

- Ensure secrets are created in the correct repository
- Check secret names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Verify secret values don't have extra spaces

## 📱 Testing Your Deployments

### Web App Testing

1. **Staging**: Use the Netlify deploy preview URL
2. **Production**: Use your production domain
3. Test responsive design on different screen sizes
4. Verify login button is no longer hidden

### Mobile App Testing

1. Download APK from GitHub Actions artifacts
2. Install on Android device
3. Test all screens for responsiveness
4. Verify navigation works correctly

## 🔄 Continuous Workflow

### Regular Development

1. **Feature Development**:

   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   # Make changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new feature"
   git push origin develop  # → Staging deployment
   ```

2. **Production Release**:
   ```bash
   # Create pull request from develop to main
   # Review and merge → Production deployment
   ```

### Rollback (If Needed)

1. Go to GitHub Actions → Rollback Deployment
2. Select environment (staging/production)
3. Enter commit SHA to rollback to
4. Run workflow

## 📊 Monitoring

- **GitHub Actions**: Monitor build success/failure
- **Netlify**: Check deployment status and analytics
- **Supabase**: Monitor API usage
- **User Feedback**: Test on various devices

## 🎯 Success Indicators

- ✅ All GitHub Actions workflows pass
- ✅ Web app deploys successfully to Netlify
- ✅ Mobile APK builds without errors
- ✅ Responsive design works on all devices
- ✅ Login button visible on mobile screens
- ✅ No UI overlap issues

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Review GitHub Actions logs for error details
3. Verify all secrets are configured correctly
4. Test with a minimal change first

## 🚀 Going Live

Once everything is working:

1. Update your domain DNS to point to Netlify (if using custom domain)
2. Submit Android app to Play Store (if ready)
3. Configure monitoring and alerts
4. Set up team access and permissions

Your CI/CD pipeline is now ready for continuous deployment! 🎉
